The Creeper is a hostile mob that will ambush players and explode, causing damage to the player and the surrounding blocks and entities. Unlike Zombies and Skeletons, Creepers will not catch fire in direct sunlight, meaning they can wander around unharmed any time of the day until it is killed or despawns. However, the creepers will still be aggressive during the day.
Creepers spawn in the overworld at night and in locations with a light level of 7 or less, just like regular hostile mobs. They are especially dangerous as they are almost completely silent (except for footsteps and their hissing noises when ready to explode), and their explosion is devastating at short range. Creepers run from Cats and Ocelots[1] and will even ignore the player to run away when a feline is too close. The Creeper has gained considerable notoriety among Minecraft players for their infuriating habit of sneaking up on the player and hurting them and damaging structures.
Creepers are one of two mobs that can never be targeted by any other mob. The other being the Ghast. Tamed wolves, Snow Golems and Iron Golems will never attack Creepers. This is because of their destructive nature upon being provoked.

Skeletons are ranged, hostile mobs that shoot arrows at the player and any other mob that attacks it. Like zombies, skeletons spawn in dimly lit areas, and will burn when directly in sunlight (when the sun is 15 degrees or greater above the ground) unless they are swimming in water. The skeleton will not burn if not directly in view of the sun, e.g. underneath a tree.
Since their initial introduction into the game, skeletons have received an AI update that has allowed them be about as "intelligent" as zombies, since they were both given similar AI updates. Skeletons can since now seek cover when on fire, and can perform many other "smarter" actions.

The spider is an arachnid-like mob that is neutral in sufficient light levels and hostile towards the player at night and in dark, shadowy areas. They are able to see the player through solid blocks. A spider measures 2 x 2 x 1 blocks, with brownish-gray skin and red eyes that glow eerily in the dark. Because of their dimensions, spiders cannot enter 1-block wide spaces that zombies, skeletons, and creepers can, but it can crawl into 1-block high gaps (as long as they are 2 or more blocks wide). Spiders' distinctive hissing noises can alert a player to their presence - creepers make a similar, much shorter noise when damaged. Spiders are easier to hit with arrows due to their size, but can quickly catch up to the player with their leaping (they can cover 2 - 3 blocks in a bound) and wall-climbing abilities. Spiders will often jump around when attacking, making them a moving target and harder to hit. When hunting, spiders move at a pace slightly slower than the player's walking speed. Unlike zombies and skeletons, spiders will not catch fire in daylight.
There is a 1% chance that a spider will spawn with a skeleton on its back, forming the dreaded Spider Jockey. The skeleton's ability to fire arrows combined with the speed, leaping, and wall-climbing of the spider makes this a very dangerous opponent.
