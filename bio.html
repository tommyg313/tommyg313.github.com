<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>My name is Tom Geheran. I am a senior mechanical engineering student at Tufts University<br/>
I grew up in New Hampshire with my mom, dad and sister. I had a fun childhood with lots of <br/>
lake swimming in the summer, sledding in the winter and sports during the school year.<br/>
In high school I started to snowboard which I fell in love with and I joined the Varsity <br/>
swimming and lacrosse teams. The end of senior year of high school I was named Prom King. <br/>
I graduated from high school in June of 2009 and went to Tufts that fall. Here I have met <br/>
friends I will have for the rest of my life and memories to match. I also learned a little <br/>
bit along the way as well.</p>
